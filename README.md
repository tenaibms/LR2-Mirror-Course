# LR2 Mirror Course

This tool allows you to use mirror on courses, it does not allow you to use random on courses however.

To use this, simply download the latest DLL from the [releases](https://github.com/tenaibms/LR2-Mirror-Course/releases) tab and inject the dll using something like [AutoInject](https://sourceforge.net/projects/autodllinjector/).
